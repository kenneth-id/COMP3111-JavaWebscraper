## Assumptions
1. Additional site tested is Carousell (https://hk.carousell.com/)
2. On Dates for Carousell: they do not have an exact posting date, only indications such as "two months ago", "a year ago", "4 days ago", etc., so e.g. if it indicates "two months ago" and today's date is 29 November 2018, we will store the date at 29 September 2018.  
3. We limit the scraping to a maximum of 5 pages, and stated the last page in console. 
4. Input refine keyword in the second textbox.
5. The refine search can only be done once (i.e. after refining once, the button will be disabled). 
6. The refine button will be disabled if there is no result from the scraping
7. FXML methods are not tested
